## Newton Theme
The N1 Newton theme is inspired by Newton mail client. I really enjoy their design, so I decided to bring it to N1.

#### Layout
Since this theme brings the Newton experience to N1, it only supports Single Panel layout. For now.

#### Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/joseqmatias/N1-Newton/archive/master.zip) and extract the Newton Theme
2. Open Nylas N1
3. Go to `Nylas N1 > Install Theme...`
4. Navigate to the extracted folder, and click Open on the selected folder
5. Party! :tada:

#### TODO
- [ ] Two Panel layout
- [ ] Preferences
